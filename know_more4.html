       <h1>Applications of html</h1>
       <h3>web pages development</h3>
       <p>Different websites we see on the internet regularly are in some form written in HTML code. As mentioned earlier HTML is used to structure the web page in various ways. We could include different sections, insert tables, and split the web page. With the introduction of Semantic HTML elements in HTML5, HTML has made hassle free even for the developer to understand and modify his/her code better. 

        Apart from the elements, we can style different types of web pages like the landing page, parallax pages, grid orientation pages, etc. Styling and manipulation of HTML elements are comparatively easier and more effective with CSS and JavaScript.
        
        </p>
        <h3>Navigating the Internet</h3>
        <p>HTML is an essential element in navigating between web pages. Navigation is possible using the hypertext concept. The linking is also simpler. From the internet user’s point of view, they click on a text which takes them to the next page. HTML facilitates navigation by hyperlinking with the help of an anchor tag.</p>
        <h3>Responsive Designs</h3>
        <p>The integral part of a web page is for it to be interactive and responsive to the user. HTML makes it possible. Unlike static pages, responsive ones also have a better reach. Automatically resizing, hiding, shrinking, or enlarging a website to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones) is what a responsive web design is made of where HTML and CSS aid the purpose. 

            <meta> tag is used on all pages to create a responsive website. In addition, images could be made responsive with the help of the width property in CSS. Texts can also be made responsive by setting it up with a “VW” unit, which means the “viewport width”.</p>
            <h3> Storage Function in the Browser</h3>
            <p>Storage of data in the browser was tedious in the past. For a user to save the data of the browser that persists between two sessions, the user’s cookies or infrastructure is to be built from the server end. This process has now been eased with HTML5. HTML5 has roped in new features. Such storage features are localStorage and IndexDB.  

                The web storage objects window.localStorage and window.sessionStorage store data with no expiration date and storage for one session respectively. The localStorage object will have the data saved even when the browser is closed. setItem and removeItem are the functions commonly used to store and remove data from the storage. Also, the most important part is that these features are supported by all browsers</p>
